                          <h3>EFSET Information</h3>
                          <p>EFSET is a language assessment designed to provide an accurate indication of a student's current English proficiency.
                              This service is used by corporate clients who assess their employees' English as part of their regular performance evaluation.
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  Employers use the results of the EFSET speaking test as part of their regular performance evaluation. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The assessment is also used to place students into a level to ensure that they are exposed to language that they are able to process and learn from.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The results you provide to the student in their EFSET assessments have a major impact on their learning experience with EF and their professional life.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The businesses we partner with will monitor these scores closely both to assess their staff and the accuracy of our assessment
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                              As a result of the impact that EFSET assessments have, employers and students expect that our assessments are:

                                  Reliable

                        <h3>Calibrations</h3>
                        <p>Calibrations provide us with an important mechanism for determining the accuracy of teachers in scoring EFSETs. This process allows us to identify the most
                            accurate teachers, and also those who require further assistance, support, and development.
                            <br><br>
                            The scores you submit as part of a calibration exercises will be compared against a set of pre-determined true scores. This comparison is the purpose of the calibration exercise, and provides us with a measurement of reliability
                            which is an important component for the businesses we partner with.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="Process" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Process-tab" style="text-align: left;">
                          <h3>Process</h3>
                          <p>A new calibration will be relased on the 1st of each month. This will be accessible either from the home page, or from the navigation bar under 'Active Calibration'. <br><br>
                            Based upon those scores, some teachers may be asked to complete a randomly assigned follow up observations to better assess scoring accuracy. These follow up observations will be sent via your centre manager. <br><br>
                            Simply click on 'Active Calibration' on the navigation bar to begin observing the most recent monthly calibration. There you will find links to the EFSET scoring standards, as well as questions and audio responses. Each calibration page
                            also has the submission form embeded at the foot of the page.

                          <h3>Guidance</h3>
                          <p>To support you in providing grading that satisfies your customers, here are some simple practices you can follow to help you achieve the best results:
                              <ol>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Listen to all of the recordings:</strong> Some of the questions that students have to respond to are quite content-specific. While you may hear a student struggle to describe the effects of pollution on the environment, 
                                  they may surprise you with how they describe the plot of their favourite movie or book; a question in which they have much more control over the content.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Refer to the rubric at all times:</strong> As you become more confident, you may begin to develop a sense of the scoring criteria and feel confident grading without the rubric. This is likely to result in your grading standards moving away from those of other assessors.
                                  Refer to the rubric to ensure that you are grading against the same set of central standards. This also ensures that students are receiving consistent feedback from us. <br><u>You can access the rubric from the home page, or from the relevant tab tab above.</u>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Always make notes:</strong> Taking notes will equip you with objective facts that you can reference against the rubric once you've listened to the recordings.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Make full use of the allocated time:</strong> Our internal QA of EFSET has shown that assessors who spend less time per submission are less accurate.
                                  You should allocate 20 minutes per correction to ensure that you have provided the necessary comments, recorded correction and have allocated enough time for grading. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <strong>Grade within one band or less:</strong> As a student's language ability develops, their skills develop at a similar pace. It is rare that one skill will develop two bands outside of another skill as the descriptors are interdependent and so are the skills themselves. Because of this, 
                                  your grades will generally be within one band of each other. E.g. Accuracy A2, Fluency B1, Range A2, Coherence A2.
                                  In the rare case that you do decide to score outside of one band, (E.g. Accuracy A2, Fluency B2, Range B2, Coherence B1) you should be prepared to justify your grades with evidence. 
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                              </p>
